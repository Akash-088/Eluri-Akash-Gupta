This programs are written in **Python (Python 3)**.
The programs are written in Python with a focus on clean, readable, and self-explanatory code.  

The commented sections of the code provide a direct execution version using predefined inputs for quick testing.  
The active (uncommented) code accepts explicit user input at runtime, enabling interactive and flexible execution.
Both versions implement identical logic and produce the same results; the difference lies only in how input is supplied.
